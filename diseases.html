                    <h2>Wheat - Rust</h2>
                    <p><strong></strong>Leaf rust causes the most damage when severe rusting covers the upper leaves before flowering.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> As the disease progresses, leaves can become deformed, discolored, and die prematurely.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Best grown in well-drained loamy soil.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Caused by Puccinia fungi that thrive in wet and humid conditions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use resistant varieties (e.g., HD 2967), apply fungicides (Mancozeb, Tebuconazole), and rotate crops to reduce pathogen buildup.</p>

                    <h2>Tomato - Early Blight</h2>
                    <p> Tomato is the most agriculturally important crop known to be affected by Alternaria linariae, although other members of Solanaceae and members of other plant families (Cucurbitaceae, Scrophulariaceae) can be affected.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptom:</strong> Early blight can occur on the foliage, fruit, and stem at any stage of development.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Well-drained loamy soil with good organic content.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Caused by *Alternaria solani*, a fungal pathogen thriving in warm, moist conditions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Maintain plant vigor. Maintaining adequate fertilization and improving host vigor can reduce susceptibility to early blight.</p>

                    <h2>Rice - Bacterial Blight</h2>
                    <p><strong></strong> Rice bacterial blight, deadly bacterial disease that is among the most destructive afflictions of cultivated rice (Oryza sativa and O. glaberrima). In severe epidemics, crop loss may be as high as 75 percent, and millions of hectares of rice are infected annually.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptom :</strong> The infected areas turn yellow and eventually brown as the disease progresses.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Grows well in clayey soil with good water retention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Caused by the bacterium *Xanthomonas oryzae*, spread through water droplets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> By properly adjusting the nitrogen fertilizers and by applying the extra dose of potash along with the last dose of nitrogen, when weather conditions are favourable.</p>

                    <h2>Banana - Panama Disease (Fusarium Wilt)</h2>
                    <p><strong></strong> anama disease, a devastating disease of bananas caused by the soil-inhabiting fungus species Fusarium oxysporum forma specialis cubense. A form of fusarium wilt, Panama disease is widespread throughout the tropics and can be found wherever susceptible banana cultivars are grown.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptom :</strong> Panama disease is a plant disease that infects banana plants. It is a wilting disease caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense . The pathogen is resistant to fungicides and its control is limited to phytosanitary measures.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Grows well in clayey soil with good water retention.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Caused by the bacterium *Xanthomonas oryzae*, spread through water droplets.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Use calcium nitrate: In some soils, using calcium nitrate instead of ammonium nitrate can reduce the severity of the disease.</p>

                    <h2>Mustard - White Rust</h2>
                    <p><strong>Symptom :</strong> Tan-yellow spots develop on the upper leaf surface opposite the pustules.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers sandy loam to loamy soil with good drainage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Caused by the fungus *Albugo candida* which thrives in humid conditions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Spray with fungicides: Spray mustard plants with fungicides like mancozeb, metalaxyl, or chlorothalonil. One study found that the highest seed yield was obtained with a combination of metalaxyl,mancozeb and rotate crops.</p>

                    <h2>Rose - Black Spot</h2>
                    <p> Rose black spot is a fungal disease of roses where purple or black spots develop on the leaves, which often drop early.</p>
                    <p><strong>Symptom :</strong> ypically, a rapidly enlarging purplish or black patch appears on the upper leaf surface, with diffuse and radiating strands of the fungus sometimes just visible.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Prefers sandy loam to loamy soil with good drainage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Caused by the fungus *Albugo candida* which thrives in humid conditions.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> After treating the plant, you must spray it weekly, starting in early spring and after a heavy rain, to prevent black spots from recurring.</p>

                    <h2>Cotton - Leaf Curl Virus</h2>
                    <p><strong>Symptom :</strong> Plants infected early in the season are stunted and the yield is drastically reduced.</p>
                    <p><strong>Soil:</strong> Best in black soil or sandy loam with proper drainage.</p>
                    <p><strong>Cause:</strong> Spread by whitefly vectors carrying the leaf curl virus.</p>
                    <p><strong>Prevention:</strong> Control whitefly populations, use virus-free seeds, and remove infected plants.</p>
